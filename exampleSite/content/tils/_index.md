Here I write things that I learn in my day to day as a software engineer. Some of these are found in StackOverflow QAs, some are found in documentations and some are found on other places on the Internet.

Main reason to write this is to keep a collection of things which I leaned and found useful.

Some of these things are used so frequently that it makes sense to write them once to remember the better.
While some of these things are used so rarely that I'll forget them on a later time when I need them and will spend hours to find them on internet. Hence it will be easier to find all such things in this one collection.

Also, hoping this might become useful to other people as well. :grimacing:
